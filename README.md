# Data-Driven-Insights-and-Predictive-Modeling

## Dataset Summary:

The data set consists of medical attributes gathered from patients in order to forecast the presence or absence of heart disease. There are 16 main attributes like age, sex, chest pain type (cp), blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol(chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting ECG results (restecg), maximal heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression (old peak),  slope of the peak exercise (slope), major number of blood vessles (ca) and thalassemia (thal),  predicated attribute(num).

**Key Insights from Analysis**

- The majority of patients belong to the age group of between 40 and 60 years.
- Males showed a higher frequency of  heart disease.
- Columns with *few missing values* (e.g., restecg, chol) can be imputed (mean/median/mode).
- Columns with *moderate missingness* (e.g., oldpeak, thalch, exang) can also be imputed if meaningful.
- Columns with *high missingness* (e.g., ca, thal, slope) may need to be dropped or carefully analyzed since much of the data is missing.
  
- **Rows**: 920
- **Columns**: 16
- **Source**: Kaggle

## Data Cleaning Used:

* **For Duplicates**:

  * For data cleaning the data set was diagnosed for missing values using  using `df.isnull().sum()`
  * Following are the column with missing values and their count:
    * trestbps : 59
    * chol: 30
    * fbs: 90
    * restecg: 2
    * thalach: 55
    * exang: 55
    * oldpeak: 62
    * slope: 309
    * ca: 611
    * thal: 486
* **For Duplicates**:

  * Detected using `df.duplicated()`
  * Removed duplicates using `df.drop_duplicates()`
* **For Data Exploration**:

  * Verified and corrected the data where necessary using `df.info()` and `df.astype()`.
* **Outliers and Noise**:

  * Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots
  * Noted some outliers in cholesterol and max heart rate which were retained for modeling context
* **Challenges Faced:**

  * Selection of  the appropiate dataset from the kaggle.
    * Initial we worked in titanic dataset however it lacked the numerical attributes which is essential for further computation.
    * Later we worked with heart disease data set with a lot of numerical data.
  * Several columns in the dataset (e.g., trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal) contained missing values â€” some with very high missing rates (e.g., ca, thal, slope). This posed a  risk of losing too much data if all rows with missing values were dropped.
  * Outliers and unrealistic values were present in the numeric columns (age, chol) could bias the models and reduce performance.
